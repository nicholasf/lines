## Compiling the protobuf

The `compile` command in the Makefile will build `event.proto`, although the generated code is currently in `./gen`. 

To build it yourself you will need to follow the instructions for using Golang with the `proto` compiler [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go-generated)
